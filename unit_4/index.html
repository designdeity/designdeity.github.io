	<p>Dimitry has demonstrated the ability time and time again to take concepts and create stunning work. Whether strictly defined or ambiguous, his print and digital work is quite impressive. Perhaps just as important as his technical competency is Dimitry's positive attitude. His friendly demeanor makes me feel comfortable requesting changes to projects and uplifts the team. Dimitry also makes a beautiful woman on Dia de los Muertos.</p>

	<p>Dimitry worked with me as a temp designer for the better part of a year. He hit the ground running, and was a great asset to my team. I was sorry to see him go when he was offered a full-time position elsewhere. Always a positive energy.</p>
