					<p>Dimitry is fantastic designer &mdash; creative, easy to work with and full of new ideas. He is open to suggestions and input from others, but is an expert in his own right &mdash; staying on top of the changing trends in graphic design. With his design colleagues, I have seen Dimitry take the role of Art Director &mdash; offering ideas and solutions to better hone their design talents.</p>

					<p>Dimitry is a top-notch designer with creativity that knows no end. In addition, he is a team player who is always "at the ready" to help his team members in the Marketing Department at CoStar Group. What continually impressed me about Dimitry was his speed, creativity and flexibility. He came to work engaged and ready to help, often assisting and mentoring younger designers and freelancers. </p>

					<p>While in our employ, Dimitry produced high-level materials for Fortune 1000 companies, leading associations, and more. Mr. Ekzarkhov is highly skilled in Photoshop and InDesign, and his expertise extends to packaging, brochures, print and electronic direct mail, advertisements, and related collateral. He is effective working in a team environment and can be trusted with confidential client information. Furthermore, Dimitry posses good communication skills with coworkers, clients, and vendors. </p>

					<p>Dimitry has demonstrated the ability time and time again to take concepts and create stunning work. Whether strictly defined or ambiguous, his print and digital work is quite impressive. Perhaps just as important as his technical competency is Dimitry's positive attitude. His friendly demeanor makes me feel comfortable requesting changes to projects and uplifts the team. Dimitry also makes a beautiful woman on Dia de los Muertos.</p>

					<p>Dimitry is a fantastic design professional that I have placed multiple times through The BOSS Group with clients in the DC metro area. Our clients have always given us rave reviews on Dimitry's professionalism, reliability and expert knowledge in graphic design. He has been requested back by clients multiple times, which isn't something that I see every day. I would recommend Dimitry for any position and find him to be adaptable to any environment!</p>

					<p>Dimitry worked with me as a temp designer for the better part of a year. He hit the ground running, and was a great asset to my team. I was sorry to see him go when he was offered a full-time position elsewhere. Always a positive energy.</p>
